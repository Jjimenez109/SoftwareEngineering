1) Cart_ID PK is 32 characters long. Searching by PK will be annoying.
    - Find way to search by tuple offset
2) Are varchar attributes filled with spaces? If so how will this affect searching by PKs
3) I thought a user was supposed to have a default payment option (a PREFERRED_CREDIT_CARD).
It's actually not necessary, so do we just remove PREFERRED_CREDIT_CARD table or keep it?
4) Should there be a homepage app? prob


Minor Issues:
1) Email is varchar, I thinnk there's an email type.
